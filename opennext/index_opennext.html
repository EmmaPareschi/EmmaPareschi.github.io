	<h3>My notes and considerations </h3>
	There are many current examples of businesses creating and selling electronic kits or modules for individual or hobbyist use.
	List of companies that sell OSH, mainly electronics:<br>
	- Arduino <br>
	- Sparkfun <br>
	- Adafruit	<br>
	- Evil Mad Scientist <br>
	all these companys provide modular system that can be combined together, but they also sell kit!<br>
	also machines:<br>
	- RepRap <br>
	<br>
	also air quality products: <br>
	- Smart citizen kit <br>

	<h3>Case studies in the Digital Fabrication of Open-Source Consumer Electronic Products </h3>

	<h4>Background.</h4>
	<u>Digital fabrication</u> is challenging the assumptions that underly mass production. It enables individual variation.<br>

	There are numerous examples of small businesses using digital fabrication for the production of consumer products:<br>
	- Freedom of Creation, 3d print for lamps, furniture, and personal accessories. (3D Systems acquired Freedom of Creation in May of 2011)<br>
	- Nervous System, jewelry and housewares, 3D printers, laser cutters, and other fabrication processes<br>
	- Wood Marvels, wooden toys composed of laser cut wood, using Ponoko as a fabrication service and showroom<br>
	Particularly when an outside service, like Ponoko, is used for the production, digital fabrication allows these companies
	to start with a minimum of start-up capital or investment.<br>

	<u>Electronic production</u>: circuit board fabrication is a mature and widespread digital fabrication technology.
