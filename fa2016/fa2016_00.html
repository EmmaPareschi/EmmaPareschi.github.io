<h1>EP</h1>

<p>To keep my notes available whenever...or at least where this a network, I created this page and decided to try github web server. I followed this intructions: <a href="https://pages.github.com"> pages.github</a>. </p>
<p> From the option I downloaded github for Mac.</p>

<h2> How to use it.</h2>
<p>I saved my github master copy in Documents and I use Sublime Text 2 to edit the html page.</p>
<p>Every time I change a file, from github Desktop app I sync, commit and sync again.</p>
