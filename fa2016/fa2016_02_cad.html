<p> INKSCAPE <br>
To install Inkscape you need to follow the instruction of the following page: <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/download/"> https://inkscape.org/en/download/ </a> (<a href="https://inkscape.org/en/download/mac-os/"> for Mac </a>).<br>
<br>
Notes: The first step is the installation of XQuartz, it can take a while, so be patient. When it's almost done, it will say: "You will need to log out and log back in to make XQuartz your default X11 server."
Also Inkscape installation takes some minutes (in my case 5min) so take your time.

<p> Inkscape and Illustrator: the scale factor between the two software is quite annoying.<br>
ink (mm) -> ai (mm) <br>
100 x 100 -> ai 97.255 / ratio factor: 2,822 <br>
