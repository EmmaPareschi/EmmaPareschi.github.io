<h2> Inkscape </h2>

<p>To install Inkscape you need to follow the instruction of the following page: <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/download/"> https://inkscape.org/en/download/ </a> (<a href="https://inkscape.org/en/download/mac-os/"> for Mac </a>).<br>
<br>
The first step is the installation of XQuartz, it can take a while, so be patient. When it's almost done, it will say: "You will need to log out and log back in to make XQuartz your default X11 server."
